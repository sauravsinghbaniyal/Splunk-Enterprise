# Splunk-Enterprise
The Splunk Enterprise Practical Lab is designed to provide hands-on experience in collecting, indexing, searching, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data using Splunk. This lab helps learners understand how Splunk is used in real-world environments for log monitoring, troubleshooting, security analysis, and operational intelligence.

In this lab, Splunk Enterprise is installed and configured to ingest data from multiple sources such as log files, system logs, and application data. Learners practice onboarding data into Splunk indexes, configuring sourcetypes, and validating proper event parsing and timestamp extraction.

The lab focuses heavily on Search Processing Language (SPL), enabling users to perform searches, filter events, generate statistics, extract fields, and correlate data across different sources. Participants create reports, dashboards, and alerts to visualize trends, monitor system health, and detect anomalies such as errors, failed logins, or high traffic patterns.

Administrative tasks such as index management, user and role creation, forwarder configuration, and license management are also covered. Learners gain exposure to Splunk configuration files (props.conf, transforms.conf) and basic troubleshooting using Splunk internal logs and the Monitoring Console.

By completing this lab, users develop practical skills required for Splunk Administrator, Power User, and Security Analyst roles, as well as preparation for Splunk certification exams and real-time industry use cases.
