# Splunk-Enterprise
The Splunk Enterprise Practical Lab provides hands-on experience in collecting, indexing, searching, analyzing, and visualizing machine data. Learners ingest logs, use SPL for searching and reporting, create dashboards and alerts, and perform basic administration tasks, preparing them for real-world Splunk roles.
